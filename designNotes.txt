Scope

1. ECS and Renderer are opaque to each other except for specified getter functions and entityHandles
2. Math types are known to all for ease of use
3. Aside from Math, everything is defined using iOCT_ types, and exposed using OCT_ types

Naming

1. API usable: OCT_
2. Internal to one module: iOCT_
3. used by multiple modules: _OCT_MOD_MOD_
4. Scheme: SCOPE_typeName_descriptionText

ECS

1. A scene is simply a collection of entitySets
2. entitSets have globally unique identifiers. 
3. entites and components have set-specific IDs, which are their index in the layer pool.
4. Each entity can have at most one of each component type. To create multiple e.g. hitBox2D, create a child entity and apply that component.
5. entites are passed between modules using entityHandles, which are also globally unique and correspond to a entitySet/entity pair. 

Renderer

1. Layers work in the same way as entitySets, but are distinct.
2. rendererObjects are linked to entities by entityHandle
3. Each time a renderable component is added to ECS componentTypes, the renderer system must handle it explicitly to request vertex data.
