ECS

1. A scene is simply a collection of layers and nothing more. 
2. Layers have globally unique identifiers. 
3. gameObjects and components have layer-specific IDs, which are their index in the layer pool.
4. Each gameObject can have at most one of each component type. To create multiple e.g. hitBox2D, create a child object and apply that component.
5. gameObjects are passed around using gameObjectHandles, which are also globally unique and correspond to a layer-gameObject pair. 

Renderer

1. Layers work in the same way, but are distinct from ECS layers.
2. rendererObjects are linked to gameObjects by gameObjectHandle
3. Each time a renderable component is added to ECS componentTypes, the renderer system must handle it explicitly to request vertex data.
