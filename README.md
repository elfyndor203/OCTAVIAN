# OCTAVIAN (WORK IN PROGRESS)
A simple modular ECS game engine written in C 

OCTAVIAN is a simple game engine designed to make me learn C. It uses a minimal entity-component structure (ECS) design to manage game data, and its subsystems (currently ECS and Renderer) are designed to be modular. A semi-functional prototype is available in the demo branch. 

# Libraries
- OpenGL 3.3
- GLAD
- GLFW

## Installation (WIP)
1. Build
2. Import .lib

## Usage (WIP)
1. Start the engine
2. Create an entityContext
3. Add the entityContext to rendering
4. Add an entity to the entityContext
5. Add any additional components to the entity
7. Handle messages
